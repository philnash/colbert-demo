While they hold tremendous promise, agent reliability has been a barrier for large-scale deployment and productionisation. We’ll cover ways to design and build reliable agents using LangGraph, which can support diverse self-corrective applications such as RAG and code generation. But, just as critically, we’ll cover ways to use LangSmith to test your agents, examining both agent's final response as well as agent tool use trajectories. Collectively, we’ll talk about three types of testing loops you can incorporate into your agent design process - at run time, pre-production, and for production monitoring.",

Drawing from three years of experience using LLMs in every aspect of his work as a principal engineer, the presenter will share practical insights and techniques that go beyond simple prompts and off-the-shelf tools.\n\nThrough a series of interactive exercises and real-world examples, participants will learn how to:\n\n1. Combine classic design patterns, such as domain-specific languages and declarative programming, with transformer-based models\n2. Identify the most effective ways to use LLMs for writing software, beyond simply having them generate code\n3. Create systems that use LLMs to write software that instructs LLMs to write more software\n\nThis workshop is designed for engineers and professionals working in software-related fields who want to use LLMs to solve concrete problems and improve their workflow. Attendees will gain valuable insights and practical techniques that they can immediately apply to their projects, regardless of their current level of expertise with LLMs.\n\nThe presenter, a passionate advocate for \"pragmatic programming\" with LLMs, has made over 6,000 GitHub contributions using these models in the past year, achieving a high level of quality that demonstrates the technology's potential.",

This workshop aims to equip participants with a range of practical skills and techniques to systematically improve their RAG systems. We'll cover topics such as benchmarking retrieval systems, employing automated clustering to identify problematic queries or topics, and leveraging Open Telemetry to ensure that internal evaluation datasets accurately reflect real-world user queries. By mastering these techniques, participants will be able to make data-driven decisions that set their RAG applications apart from the competition.\n",

We run TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM in production and have seen both the incredible performance gains it offers and the hurdles to overcome in getting it up and running. In this workshop, participants will learn how to start using TensorRT-LLM, including selecting a model to optimize, building an engine for it with TensorRT-LLM, setting batch sizes and sequence lengths, and running it on a cloud GPU.",

We will use MongoDB as the agent's memory provider and knowledge store, open-source LLMs as the agent’s “brain”, and LangChain to orchestrate the end-to-end agentic workflow.\n\nAttendees will be provided with all the resources required to successfully execute the hands-on portions of the workshop, including a GitHub repository consisting of notebook templates with pseudocode. Attendees will replace the pseudocode with their own code during the workshop. ",

Setup and Introduction to GitHub Copilot -- this will be a brief introduction to GitHub Copilot and how to use it in your workflow. A longer workshop on this topic will be held later in the day. Please create a GitHub account before the workshop if you do not already have one. If you already have GitHub Copilot, you are welcome to use it during the workshop. We will also be able to provide access for individuals who have not yet signed up for GitHub Copilot. 2. Extending GitHub Copilot -- this will be a hands-on workshop where we will walk through how to create a custom GitHub Copilot Extension. We will provide a template that you can use to create your own extension that will work with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot Chat. You will need to have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer to participate in this workshop, alongside the GitHub Copilot Chat preview extension. Links will be provided during the workshop. 3. Building your own custom GPT. Using GitHub Copilot and GitHub Codespaces to build your own custom GPT using OpenAI's Assistants API. This will require your own OpenAI API key.",

                        "about": "RAG \u0026 LLM Frameworks: Learn about practical graph design patterns and retrieval strategies to more effectively customize GenAI for real-world applications. While GenAI offers great potential, it faces challenges with hallucination and lack of domain knowledge. Graph-powered retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) helps overcome these challenges by integrating vector search with knowledge graphs and data science techniques to improve context, semantic understanding, and personalization while facilitating real-time updates. \nYou'll receive detailed coded examples to begin your journey with GenAI and graphs, leaving with practical skills to apply immediately to your own projects.\n\nPrerequisites: This is a hands-on workshop where you can follow along with Jupyter notebooks in Colab.  We will provide links to notebooks at the beginning of the workshop. To follow along please:\n- Bring your laptop\n- Create a Google account ahead of time if you don’t have one already so you can run Colab notebooks.\n- [Prefered] Bring a working openAI API key. We will provide a key for those that do not have one yet. To make a new key, create an OpenAI account or sign in. Next, navigate to the API key page and \"Create new secret key\". Optionally naming the key. Save this somewhere safe, and do not share it with others. We recommend testing your key to make sure it works - see the OpenAI quickstart tutorial for more details. ",

He also spends a lot of time talking with developers in order to better understand how to make Convex the fastest, most reliable and easy-to-use development platform on the planet. If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it's a passion that never left. His free time is spent reading programming books (no joke), and playing covers of 90s pop songs on his guitar while singing extremely loudly and beautifully.\n",

Showcase demos using Generative AI (Vertex API, AI studio, LearnML) to detect misconceptions in math learning, support creative coding, create simulations to test scientific hypotheses, curate and sumarize research \u0026 identiy blind spots in one’s thinking.  The goal of our demos will be to demonstrate  how mights we use multimodal ai to support learning activities where the agency is balanced between learners and AI and we encourage people to discover the limitations of these technologies while developing a critical use of it, know if, when and how to use it when learning new skills.",

Part art, part science, we’ll share with you practical lessons in dataset construction at Character AI and how to build a data platform to support rapid iterative refinement of training data. For LLMs, data scale is much larger and workloads are more diverse. This is especially true for multimodal datasets. To deal with these challenges, we'll show you how LanceDB is used in production to solve many pain-points around the storage, management, and querying of large scale AI data.",

AI-integrated programs should be built just like any other program: by relating small semantic tasks to each other in order to automate a larger task. Right now, the main problem preventing developers from running 10-20 AI modules on a single user request is an infrastructure one, and that’s what we’re solving. Large companies like Google have built internal infrastructure and SDKs to enable this, but we’re offering this capability to any developer.",

What if there was a way to increase the reliability of Large Language Models at no cost? Enter structured generation. In this talk we will explore how the output of models can be steered at no extra cost, why this improves their efficiency and accuracy significantly and makes generation less sensitive to the specifics of the prompt. By the end of the talk, we'll understand how we can start benefiting from this breakthrough today by using the open source library Outlines.",

Establishing the p99s necessary has to happen at the model level, yet most finance domain-specific LLMs are either only pre-training (BloombergGPT) or using supervised fine-tuning (FinBERT). \n\nThis presentation reveals how we transformed an open-source model into Albatross (https://huggingface.co/gradientai/v-alpha-tross), capable of performing at the top of the leaderboard on chat as well as domain-specific tasks. Our journey involved an intensive data pipeline and training regiment, incorporating a combination of continual pre-training, fine-tuning, and preference optimization, to customize the model for the intricacies of financial tasks. We'll share our insights on overcoming the execution hurdle, which is often the downfall of AI projects in specialized domains.",

The personal AI assistant we all want surely has to know us as individuals, right? Today’s AI assistants either give us generic information, or require significant input from us before providing useful personalized assistance. Isn’t there a better path? Of course there is. In this talk, we’ll discuss our implementation of a personal, private, proactive AI assistant that begins its relationship with you by downloading your transaction logs from major B2C sites (think of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Doordash, Strava, Uber and dozens of others) to your local device. By building a RAG system using this data, our personal AI assistant becomes useful immediately, without requiring significant user input. Learn how a modest amount of very powerful personal data can unlock the power and potential of personal AI assistants.\"",

But that's true of both poetry, and of LLMs! Well, Knowledge Graphs excel at capturing context. How can combining Knowledge Graphs with RAG – an emerging technique known as GraphRAG – give context to your RAG application, and lead to more accurate and complete results, accelerated development, and explainable AI decisions? This talk will go deep on the why and how of GraphRAG, and where best to apply it. You’ll get concepts, examples, and specifics on how you can get started. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how GraphRAG can improve the context you pass to the LLM and the performance of your AI applications.",

Meanwhile Transformers already have a key/query mechanism built in! In this talk, we'll introduce Extended Mind Transformers, a new flavor of transformer that allows the model to select and attend to the most relevant information at each generation step. We demonstrate EMT's state-of-the-art performance and discuss important design decisions for long context applications.",

Those 'aha' moments define scientific reasoning: of many steps and non-obvious. \n\nEven though the scientific discovery using LLMs is becoming more popular recently, there is little if any discussion about high level reasoning process behind breakthroughs in science.\n\nSome of the discoveries like RNA interference required connecting of distanced areas of biology, described in different journals and with distinct vocabulary. \nIn this talk we would like to discuss if LLMs would be able to spot those novel relationships behind phenomenas from distanced areas? What would it take: RAG, Agentic RAG or fully fledged AI agent?\n\nWe will first try to classify problems tackled by RAGs. Then we would define a new family of NLP problems related to the scientific discovery and propose a template for benchmarking of thereof.\nWe would discuss them on the examples of Nobel Prize discoveries. \nThen the question would be if and how RAGs or more general AI Agents might help us in tackling those problems, so we will try to entertain you with some\nattempts to solve it.\"",

We will focus on leveraging Vector Search, specifically Atlas Vector Search, over MongoDB data to improve information retrieval and generation processes.\n\nWe will show how to build a RAG system using a Parent Child Retrieval Strategy to enable more efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information. Additionally, we will show how all of this can be done within the MongoDB document model rather than relying on implementing these relationships in the application layer. And finally, we will introduce the concept of Search Nodes which enable you to serve vector search workloads at scale.\n\nThis talk is aimed at developers, ML engineers, and data scientists interested in building AI powered experiences with RAG. By the end of the session, attendees will have a solid understanding of how Retrieval Augmented Generation, Vector Search, and MongoDB can be leveraged to build innovative and scalable AI-powered applications.\n",

Unlike traditional software, agentic systems rely on non-deterministic and oftentimes difficult to predict decision making. Taking inspiration from fields like robotics, cybernetics, and biology, we can start to develop intuitions around how to build systems that are ~more~ reliable than the sum of their individual stochastic parts.",

Or does it fundamentally transform and improve user adoption and interaction? We'll explore the impact of anthropomorphizing AI agents on user engagement, and share insights from letting end-users completely customize their own agents’ personalities. \n\nDiscover the engineering practices required to develop agents with unique personas, the technical challenges debugging a product with infinite(!) customizability, and why you may never say the phrase \"works on my machine\" ever again. Get ready to rethink the relationship between AI and users in this deep dive into the world of personality-driven agent design.\n",

They would bring in people that have an affinity for both AI and applications together to form the first change agent in a company. Once you have a few teams, you notice that there is shared AI infrastructure, you need enablement and governance across. This pattern has been used to introduce Cloud, Security and Developer Experience. \n\nIn this talk we highlight:\n- the shared components of the AI stack: proxies, caching, testing, feedback collection, guardrails, ...\n- the steps (and struggles) to enable this across the whole engineering (hackathons, training, abstractions)\n- how it fits in the existing SDLC workflow and processes (testing , versioning, observability , security)\n- how we can leverage the knowledge of all platform teams together (cloudops, secops , developer experience , data platform and ai platform) for dealing with security , permissions and performance\"",

Existing benchmarks and tools often fall short in addressing the complexities of LLM evaluation in real-world production settings, the lack of a robust LLM evals tool presents a significant obstacle for AI engineers to move LLM applications from pilot to production. As LLMs find widespread utility across domains, the need for domain-specific metrics and comprehensive test sets also grows. Developing such evaluation systems demands deep AI expertise and understanding of developer user experience, few existing solutions meet these requirements. Successful LLM evaluation platforms will 1) prioritize integration into the development lifecycle, 2) automate test set generation with the right distribution and diversity to capture a wide range of real-world edge cases. and 3) continuously monitor and evaluate model performance in production, often in real-time. While LLM evaluation is still in its infancy, we see this area as one of the most exciting opportunities for startups to innovate in.",

Understanding how to effectively size a production grade LLM deployment requires understanding of the model(s), the compute hardware, quantization and parallelization methods, KV Cache budgets, input and output token length predictions, model adapter management and much more. \n\nIf you want to deeply understand these topics and their effects on LLM inference cost and performance you will enjoy this talk. \n\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\n- Why LLM inference is different to standard deep learning inference\n- Current and future NVIDIA GPU overview - which GPU(s) for which models and why\n- Understanding the importance of building inference engines\n- Deep recap on the attention mechanism along with different types of popular attention mechanisms used in production\n- Deep dive on KV Cache and managing KV Cache budgets to increase throughput per model deployment\n- Parallelism (reducing latency) - mainly tensor parallelism but data, sequence, pipeline and expert parallelism will be highlighted\n- Quantization methods on weights, activations, KV Cache to reduce engine sizes for more effective GPU utilization\n- Increasing throughput with inflight batching and other techniques\n- Detailed performance analysis of LLM deployments looking at Time to first token, inter-token latencies, llm deployment characterizations, and more  that can help reduce deployment costs\n\nThe main inference engine referenced in the talk with TRT-LLM and the open-source inference serve NVIDIA Triton.\"",

For some, recent AI developments might even pose a disruptive shift for their products and company, but how do you balance rapid prototyping and exploration of these disruptive technologies with catering to your current user base to avoid the Innovator's Dilemma? Should you add AI to every product team's roadmap or form a dedicated AI team? How do you experiment with entirely new AI endeavors without risking your current customer base? In other words, how do you cook with fire without burning down the kitchen?  \n\nIn this discussion round, Dominik Kundel will share how Twilio has been tackling some of these challenges, their learnings and what changes/iterations they have been going through to address those learnings, followed by an open discussion for others to share their learnings.",

This case study will cover the strategic evolution from conception, through to launch, and continuous iteration and refinement.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\n- Strategic partnership: The collaboration with OpenAI to launch Khanmigo alongside GPT4, going from prototype to fully launched product in 3 months time. I will delve into the why and how behind our decision to partner with OpenAI, and to leverage generative AI in our product.\n- Cultural shift in product development: The transition from our previous, more traditional product development approach to a highly experimental, prototype-driven culture. This section will highlight how we embedded AI across all teams to enhance our mission, moving beyond isolated AI projects to fully integrate AI into our operational fabric.\n- Khanmigo in action: An in-depth look at Khanmigo's functionality and its solution to real-world challenges faced by students and teachers, coupled with it's impact in real classrooms around the US.\n- Ongoing technical challenges and scaling: An overview of the technical obstacles encountered in scaling and maintaining quality as we continued to add more users.\n- Ethical considerations and AI safety: How we thought of AI safety in the context of the classroom, and delivered on an experience that parents and educators trust. \n- Pilot programs and iterative learning: Insights from our pilot programs across various school districts, focusing on how we've used feedback and data to refine and enhance Khanmigo's capabilities.\"",

                        "about": "With nearly two-thirds of enterprise developers planning production deployments of large language models this year, LLM evaluation has never been more important. LLM evaluation is also an area where confusion reigns, starting with ambiguity around what “LLM evals” even means. Often, LLM model evaluation – quantifying general fitness (i.e. on the Hugging Face leaderboard) –  is conflated with task-specific LLM system evaluation. And while many foundation model providers offer their own evals, AI engineers building LLM systems designed to plug into many models or tools need a way to objectively evaluate both different foundation models and their own systems with rigorous techniques. In this session, Arize AI founder Aparna Dhinakaran will release research onstage and walk attendees through real life examples of building an LLM Eval from scratch. This session will build on multiple research pieces that have garnered millions of views across social platforms, diving into techniques to build out robust LLM evals and ultimately gain a better understanding of the limits of LLM capabilities. Want to build your own LLM task evals for a specific use case leveraging open source tools? Want to see the latest research on which foundation models your company should be using for specific use cases? You won’t want to miss this session!",

Evaluation systems allow you to improve your AI quickly in a systematic way and unlock superpowers like the ability to curate data for fine-tuning.  However, many practitioners struggle with how to construct evaluation systems that are specific to their problems. \n\nIn this talk, we will walk through a detailed example of how to construct domain-specific evaluation systems.\"",

We were also one of the first companies to build and ship AI features into our core products. We've had the opportunity to work with Braintrust since the early days of the product, which now powers the evaluation and observability infrastructure across our AI features.  \n\nWe’ll walk through a couple of our projects – AI Zap Builder and Zapier Copilot – and how we built them from the ground up with evals and observability in mind. Hopefully, you can walk away with a few of our learnings from operating these projects at scale while systematically improving their performance.",

In this talk we’ll discuss the emerging concept of the GenAI maturity curve and define the steps along it. We’ll also discuss the concrete triggers you should watch for to indicate that you’re ready to move up to the next step.\n\nAt OpenPipe we’ve helped customers fine-tune thousands of models (and redirected thousands more who hadn’t hit the trigger points). Let’s talk about how to speed-run that journey!",

This talk will show examples of how LLMs fail when not given the proper tools and practical demonstrations of how pre-LLM tools already make developers superhuman. Explore a concrete set of challenges around user interfaces for AI and a vision for what superintelligent developer assistants might look like.",

With the recent rise of generative AI technologies, we have a new event more precious digital resource fueling the digital economy: knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has presented a first generative AI use case for organizations to use their knowledge resources, like documentation, knowledge bases, and code repositories. This talk explores various other ways that organizations can use the knowledge resources they ingest for RAG to fuel growth and productivity. Use cases for knowledge resources covered in this presentation include: traditional natural language processing, fine-tuning models, and creating knowledge APIs for AI agents to consume. Attendees will come away from this talk with actionable guidance on how they can leverage their knowledge resources for maximum efficacy.",

In this talk, we'll get into why adversarial examples are becoming increasingly relevant with the advent of agentic multimodal LLMs and what we can do to defend these models.",

ChatGPT doesn’t know anything about your codebase, and even tools that are supposed to be able to answer questions about it often fail.\n\nStarting from simply being able to talk about a single file, to being able to include specific files, then incorporating code search, coding assistants have evolved a lot over the past year or so.\n\nHowever, most coding assistants are still not able to incorporate the full context of your codebase as well as things like Linear issues, design docs on Notion, and more.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll take you on a journey of how we fixed this problem by leveraging new and interesting strategies to incorporate just the right context without blowing up your context window.\"",

Enter OctoStack, the new Generative AI inference stack that you can deploy to any environment. In this talk, we'll tell you exactly how we got OctoStack to outperform DIY deployments, including VLLM, by 10X for high-concurrency use cases. We've spent a decade optimizing the heck out of the whole stack, and now we're ready spill all our secrets. If speculative decoding, custom kernels and CUDA graphs pique your interest, you're our kind of nerd. Come check it out! ",

Identifying and mitigating hallucinations is critical for trustworthy LLM application deployment at scale. In this talk, we will showcase ChainPoll – a unique and powerful methodology to evaluate the quality of LLM outputs, focusing on RAG and fine-tuning use cases. ChainPoll-based metrics have showcased a roughly 85% correlation with human feedback while being low-cost and low-latency to compute. \n\nExpected takeaways:\n\n- Deep dive into research-backed metrics to evaluate the quality of the inputs (data quality, RAG context quality, etc.) and outputs (hallucinations) while building LLM-powered applications\n- Evaluation and experimentation framework while prompt engineering with RAG and fine-tuning with your own data\n- A demo-led practical guide to building guardrails and mitigating hallucinations\"",

Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (ColBERT) can overcome the shortcomings of traditional RAG, but how do you implement ColBERT at scale?\n\nThis talk introduces ColBERT, how it improves upon simple vector search, and how you can use it with the open-source RAGStack. Through live demos, you'll see how you can implement ColBERT embeddings, index them in Astra DB and build better retrieval for your GenAI application.\"",

A systematic approach suggests a robust evaluation system is required to properly understand how every tiny design decision influences total system performance. When working with open source LLMs like Llama 3, the need to rigorously evaluate is crucial as many more adjustments can be made that influence the Tool Calling process.\n\nDuring this talk you will learn what a baseline evaluation looks like and how a tradeoff surface emerges as you decide on implementation details like fine tuning, prompt/encoding choices, streaming, retries, and more.",

Navigating a sea of cloud providers or trying to rapidly scale up on-prem compute can be difficult at best -- just when you find the perfect solution at a fair price, you learn the lead time is too long or the hardware is not as reliable as advertised. If only there was a way to access exactly the amount of training compute power you need precisely when you need it.\nWe are excited to introduce 1-Click Clusters, a new way to perform distributed training at scale. 1CC is a flexible way to access GPU clusters of all sizes for weeks or months at a time. Whether your project needs a quick burst of extra power or might scale up and down over time, you can reserve compute as simply as booking a hotel room. We will discuss features and how things work beneath the software to help you learn what to look out for and how to maximize your training efficiency.",

                        "about": "RAG is the goto approach for AI to interact with data that it is not trained on. But beyond simple PoCs, writing your own RAG pipeline can be frustratingly complex. Why? Because fundamentally users can ask all kinds of questions that you as a developer may not have prepared for. So what we really need is AI doing RAG for us. Enter agentic RAG.\n\nIn this talk, we make a case for why agentic RAG is the future of RAG apps. Instead of spending time setting up complex RAG pipelines, developers should be spending time preparing quality data and letting the RAG agents do the heavy lifting of query planning, data retrieval and LLM orchestration. Developers should also be able to observe the RAG agent and be able to make it perform better continuously. We will show a quick demo of Pacha, the world’s first RAG agent that works with private data.",

While LLMs offer great potential, they can face challenges with lack of domain knowledge and hallucination. GraphRAG helps overcome these challenges by integrating vector search with knowledge graphs and data science techniques to improve context, semantic understanding, and personalization while facilitating real-time updates. In this session, we will cover GraphRAG through a real-world practical example, from creating a starter knowledge graph with a vector index to identifying and implementing useful GraphRAG patterns in a GenAI application.",

You will come away with an understanding of how knowledge graphs can play the critical role of left brain to complement the statistically-derived LLM + Vector right brain. You will hear how these two techniques can work together to create more reliable and powerful solutions, in an enterprise landscape where many GenAI use cases call for the use of both hemispheres.",

We’ve gone from simply leveraging AI to generate code to explaining existing code, generating unit tests, propose fixes for bugs, making code robust / secure, summarizing pull requests, having conversations tailored to your organization’s repositories, providing answers to your questions based on your organization’s knowledge base and so much more! Let's explore how to get started with GitHub Copilot, its ever growing list of capabilities, and how to make the most out of the tool.",

This talk explores the capabilities and power of the Modular Mojo programming language and Modular Accelerated Xecution (MAX) platform, which unifies CPU and GPU programming into a single Pythonic programming model that is simple and extensible. This results in reduced complexity and improved developer productivity, and streamlines innovation. We'll walk through CPU and GPU support with real-world examples, providing details of how AI application developers can use MAX and Mojo to define an end-to-end AI pipeline and overcome the complexities.

What if the key to understanding the intricate mechanics of LLMs didn't require a Ph.D.? This session offers an innovative approach, employing spreadsheets to dissect and demystify the architecture of decoder-based LLMs using a fully working implementation of GPT-2 entirely in Excel. Attendees will tour through GPT-2's architecture from tokenization, embeddings, attention, multi-layer perceptron, all translated into the accessible format of spreadsheets with minimal abstractions to get in the way. By the end, you'll gain unparalleled insights into AI's backbone, transforming abstract concepts into tangible, understandable processes, without ever touching code.",

                        "about": "\"Over the last 3 months, summarize the top billing issues faced by my enterprise customers within the first 30 days of their onboarding.\"\"\n\nOn the surface, building an internal AI customer intelligence application that can answer questions like this is a perfect use-case for Gen AI.\nHowever, building a production ready app that retrieves the data (RAG) before hauling it off to your favorite LLM for summarization soon becomes a terrible engineering experience. \n\nThe data is spread across 3 places: a tickets database (eg: elastic), a CRM (eg: salesforce) and your user-accounts transactional database (eg: postgres).\nIn production, your app can't access the data from these databases directly. Given security \u0026 privacy concerns, your app won't have direct access to these databases.\nMaking independent retrieval requests to each of these sources and then joining them in memory might be prohibitively expensive and needs a level of query planning to do efficiently.\nMoving all data into one location is expensive to build, maintain and govern \nPredictable quality is further made hard because underlying data formats and storage interfaces are continuously changing.\nDifferent types of user queries might require additional filtering and joining of data, which becomes hard to generalize.\n\nAPIs solve almost all of these very well known challenges. APIs offer standardization and security. APIs can provide a stable contract to interact with underlying data.\nAnd in all likelihood, you already have APIs on these internal and external data sources. \n\nIronically, while APIs have become a necessity for other parts of the stack, they are clearly not the first thing that AI engineers building RAG reach for. \n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss:\nWhy API based retrieval doesn't work well for RAG\nWhat we need from our existing internal and external APIs to make them RAG ready\nHow we can get existing APIs to become RAG ready without needing to rebuild the APIs\n\nBased on our work at Hasura with early-stage AI startups and Fortune 100 customers alike, I'll share key learnings on how we can set the stage to experiment and productionize RAG.\n\nThis talk will be technical, with code demos (possibly with some live coding!) and end with key resources (reference architectures, API best practices, tools/technologies) that attendees can take back to their work.\"",

It's easy to build a prototype of agents, but it's still a lot of engineering work to get them to perform reliably. Infrastructure (and tooling) can help make this easier - but thinking about and understanding your application's \"cognitive architecture\" will always be necessary. This talk will discuss new infrastructure (and tooling) that still gives you full control of the \"cognitive architecture\" of your application.",

                        "about": "AGI is the north star for all the central players in AI, but it’s unclear what AGI is and how it could be useful. What would it take to build a general intelligence that’s truly useful to humanity—a general-purpose toolkit that levels up the intelligence of both humans and computers while keeping us in the driver’s seat? We propose Useful General Intelligence (UGI): a common language for humans and computers. UGI is both a meta-tool for doing computer work and a meta-interface for the computer, and it involves agents that not only execute explicitly stated goals but also infer them implicitly. In this talk, we show how we’re developing the building blocks for UGI with a range of enterprise customers. ",

How can we possibly train, serve, and maintain models for all of these, at global, real-time scale? We build off of pre-trained models and an increasingly mature open-source ecosystem. In this talk, we'll cover how we've dramatically accelerated our modeling pipeline with (1) human-AI hybrid dataset generation for different harm vectors, (2) automated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of open-source large language and multimodal models for violation detection, and (3) serving fine-tuned adapters efficiently in real-time and at scale using LoRAX and cascade classification.",

And now, faced with actually deploying these models at scale, AI engineers and builders are left to pick up the pieces on how to improve latency and resource consumption practically. In parallel, the on-device AI movement is heating up, imposing even more physical constraints on AI model deployment. In this talk, we will first identify key sources of inefficiency in AI models. Then, we will discuss techniques and practical tools to improve efficiency, from model architecture selection, to quantization, to prompt optimization.",

However, the efficient deployment of LLMs in production environments reveals a landscape of challenges and technical debt.\n\nEthically, LLMs face issues such as bias amplification, where they might perpetuate existing stereotypes in their outputs. Misinformation is another concern, with the potential misuse of LLMs to create convincing yet false narratives. Privacy risks emerge from LLMs possibly memorizing and revealing personal data. Moreover, societal challenges include the impact on employment, as LLMs could automate tasks but also lead to job displacement. These challenges highlight the need for careful management and ethical considerations in the deployment of LLMs.\n\nIn this talk, Ahmed will highlight the key challenges and technical debt associated with LLMs' deployment, which demands customization and sophisticated engineering solutions not readily available in broad-use machine learning libraries or inference engines.\"",

What if there was a better way to train, fine-tune, and serve models on accelerated compute infrastructure entirely in Python? See how during this session where we fine-tune 20 Llama models without doing any infrastructure work. Startups and enterprises can finally gain unprecedented speed and agility to build, iterate, and deploy anything that they can imagine, from multi-agent, multi-modal AI applications, to digital twins for real world simulation. What used to take weeks with dozens of best-in-class engineers can now be accomplished in hours from a single notebook.",

This sparse distribution of model state puts increasing pressure on cluster-level networking while training. At Crusoe Cloud, we’ve built a high-performance InfiniBand network that's designed to provide the highest possible performance for these state-of-the-art training techniques. We use a “rail-optimized” design, reducing the number of hops between any set of GPUs in our cluster, accelerating all2all performance, and reducing training time. Learn more about how to utilize Crusoe Cloud rail-optimized networks to accelerate your training workloads.",

                        "about": "This talk explores how MongoDB's Aggregation Framework transcends limitations of \"classic RAG\". While RAG utilizes vector representations and semantic relevance for data retrieval, it often relies on pre-defined knowledge bases, limiting the scope of analysis. The Aggregation Framework, on the other hand, empowers you to analyze entire collections directly within MongoDB. Furthermore, the Aggregation Framework offers unparalleled flexibility for complex calculations and data transformation.",

While they hold tremendous promise, agent reliability has been a barrier for large-scale deployment and productionisation. We’ll cover ways to design and build reliable agents using LangGraph, which can support diverse self-corrective applications such as RAG and code generation. But, just as critically, we’ll cover ways to use LangSmith to test your agents, examining both agent's final response as well as agent tool use trajectories. Collectively, we’ll talk about three types of testing loops you can incorporate into your agent design process - at run time, pre-production, and for production monitoring.",

Drawing from three years of experience using LLMs in every aspect of his work as a principal engineer, the presenter will share practical insights and techniques that go beyond simple prompts and off-the-shelf tools.\n\nThrough a series of interactive exercises and real-world examples, participants will learn how to:\n\n1. Combine classic design patterns, such as domain-specific languages and declarative programming, with transformer-based models\n2. Identify the most effective ways to use LLMs for writing software, beyond simply having them generate code\n3. Create systems that use LLMs to write software that instructs LLMs to write more software\n\nThis workshop is designed for engineers and professionals working in software-related fields who want to use LLMs to solve concrete problems and improve their workflow. Attendees will gain valuable insights and practical techniques that they can immediately apply to their projects, regardless of their current level of expertise with LLMs.\n\nThe presenter, a passionate advocate for \"pragmatic programming\" with LLMs, has made over 6,000 GitHub contributions using these models in the past year, achieving a high level of quality that demonstrates the technology's potential.",

While GenAI offers great potential, it faces challenges with hallucination and lack of domain knowledge. Graph-powered retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) helps overcome these challenges by integrating vector search with knowledge graphs and data science techniques to improve context, semantic understanding, and personalization while facilitating real-time updates. \nYou'll receive detailed coded examples to begin your journey with GenAI and graphs, leaving with practical skills to apply immediately to your own projects.\n\nPrerequisites: This is a hands-on workshop where you can follow along with Jupyter notebooks in Colab.  We will provide links to notebooks at the beginning of the workshop. To follow along please:\n- Bring your laptop\n- Create a Google account ahead of time if you don’t have one already so you can run Colab notebooks.\n- [Prefered] Bring a working openAI API key. We will provide a key for those that do not have one yet. To make a new key, create an OpenAI account or sign in. Next, navigate to the API key page and \"Create new secret key\". Optionally naming the key. Save this somewhere safe, and do not share it with others. We recommend testing your key to make sure it works - see the OpenAI quickstart tutorial for more details. ",

He also spends a lot of time talking with developers in order to better understand how to make Convex the fastest, most reliable and easy-to-use development platform on the planet. If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it's a passion that never left. His free time is spent reading programming books (no joke), and playing covers of 90s pop songs on his guitar while singing extremely loudly and beautifully.\n",

The goal of our demos will be to demonstrate  how mights we use multimodal ai to support learning activities where the agency is balanced between learners and AI and we encourage people to discover the limitations of these technologies while developing a critical use of it, know if, when and how to use it when learning new skills.",

Part art, part science, we’ll share with you practical lessons in dataset construction at Character AI and how to build a data platform to support rapid iterative refinement of training data. For LLMs, data scale is much larger and workloads are more diverse. This is especially true for multimodal datasets. To deal with these challenges, we'll show you how LanceDB is used in production to solve many pain-points around the storage, management, and querying of large scale AI data.",

Right now, the main problem preventing developers from running 10-20 AI modules on a single user request is an infrastructure one, and that’s what we’re solving. Large companies like Google have built internal infrastructure and SDKs to enable this, but we’re offering this capability to any developer.",

What if there was a way to increase the reliability of Large Language Models at no cost? Enter structured generation. In this talk we will explore how the output of models can be steered at no extra cost, why this improves their efficiency and accuracy significantly and makes generation less sensitive to the specifics of the prompt. By the end of the talk, we'll understand how we can start benefiting from this breakthrough today by using the open source library Outlines.",

Establishing the p99s necessary has to happen at the model level, yet most finance domain-specific LLMs are either only pre-training (BloombergGPT) or using supervised fine-tuning (FinBERT). \n\nThis presentation reveals how we transformed an open-source model into Albatross (https://huggingface.co/gradientai/v-alpha-tross), capable of performing at the top of the leaderboard on chat as well as domain-specific tasks. Our journey involved an intensive data pipeline and training regiment, incorporating a combination of continual pre-training, fine-tuning, and preference optimization, to customize the model for the intricacies of financial tasks. We'll share our insights on overcoming the execution hurdle, which is often the downfall of AI projects in specialized domains.",

            "about": "\"Despite their trillions of tokens of training data, GPT4 and others models can’t answer a single question about us as unique individuals. The personal AI assistant we all want surely has to know us as individuals, right? Today’s AI assistants either give us generic information, or require significant input from us before providing useful personalized assistance. Isn’t there a better path? Of course there is. In this talk, we’ll discuss our implementation of a personal, private, proactive AI assistant that begins its relationship with you by downloading your transaction logs from major B2C sites (think of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Doordash, Strava, Uber and dozens of others) to your local device. By building a RAG system using this data, our personal AI assistant becomes useful immediately, without requiring significant user input. Learn how a modest amount of very powerful personal data can unlock the power and potential of personal AI assistants.\"",

Well, Knowledge Graphs excel at capturing context. How can combining Knowledge Graphs with RAG – an emerging technique known as GraphRAG – give context to your RAG application, and lead to more accurate and complete results, accelerated development, and explainable AI decisions? This talk will go deep on the why and how of GraphRAG, and where best to apply it. You’ll get concepts, examples, and specifics on how you can get started. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how GraphRAG can improve the context you pass to the LLM and the performance of your AI applications.",

Those 'aha' moments define scientific reasoning: of many steps and non-obvious. \n\nEven though the scientific discovery using LLMs is becoming more popular recently, there is little if any discussion about high level reasoning process behind breakthroughs in science.\n\nSome of the discoveries like RNA interference required connecting of distanced areas of biology, described in different journals and with distinct vocabulary. \nIn this talk we would like to discuss if LLMs would be able to spot those novel relationships behind phenomenas from distanced areas? What would it take: RAG, Agentic RAG or fully fledged AI agent?\n\nWe will first try to classify problems tackled by RAGs. Then we would define a new family of NLP problems related to the scientific discovery and propose a template for benchmarking of thereof.\nWe would discuss them on the examples of Nobel Prize discoveries. \nThen the question would be if and how RAGs or more general AI Agents might help us in tackling those problems, so we will try to entertain you with some\nattempts to solve it.\"",

Additionally, we will show how all of this can be done within the MongoDB document model rather than relying on implementing these relationships in the application layer. And finally, we will introduce the concept of Search Nodes which enable you to serve vector search workloads at scale.\n\nThis talk is aimed at developers, ML engineers, and data scientists interested in building AI powered experiences with RAG. By the end of the session, attendees will have a solid understanding of how Retrieval Augmented Generation, Vector Search, and MongoDB can be leveraged to build innovative and scalable AI-powered applications.\n",

Or does it fundamentally transform and improve user adoption and interaction? We'll explore the impact of anthropomorphizing AI agents on user engagement, and share insights from letting end-users completely customize their own agents’ personalities. \n\nDiscover the engineering practices required to develop agents with unique personas, the technical challenges debugging a product with infinite(!) customizability, and why you may never say the phrase \"works on my machine\" ever again. Get ready to rethink the relationship between AI and users in this deep dive into the world of personality-driven agent design.\n",

They would bring in people that have an affinity for both AI and applications together to form the first change agent in a company. Once you have a few teams, you notice that there is shared AI infrastructure, you need enablement and governance across. This pattern has been used to introduce Cloud, Security and Developer Experience. \n\nIn this talk we highlight:\n- the shared components of the AI stack: proxies, caching, testing, feedback collection, guardrails, ...\n- the steps (and struggles) to enable this across the whole engineering (hackathons, training, abstractions)\n- how it fits in the existing SDLC workflow and processes (testing , versioning, observability , security)\n- how we can leverage the knowledge of all platform teams together (cloudops, secops , developer experience , data platform and ai platform) for dealing with security , permissions and performance\"",

            "about": "LLM evaluation is one of the most important questions for AI engineers today. Existing benchmarks and tools often fall short in addressing the complexities of LLM evaluation in real-world production settings, the lack of a robust LLM evals tool presents a significant obstacle for AI engineers to move LLM applications from pilot to production. As LLMs find widespread utility across domains, the need for domain-specific metrics and comprehensive test sets also grows. Developing such evaluation systems demands deep AI expertise and understanding of developer user experience, few existing solutions meet these requirements. Successful LLM evaluation platforms will 1) prioritize integration into the development lifecycle, 2) automate test set generation with the right distribution and diversity to capture a wide range of real-world edge cases. and 3) continuously monitor and evaluate model performance in production, often in real-time. While LLM evaluation is still in its infancy, we see this area as one of the most exciting opportunities for startups to innovate in.",

            "about": "\"LLM inference is not your normal deep learning model deployment nor is it trivial when it comes to managing scale, performance and COST. Understanding how to effectively size a production grade LLM deployment requires understanding of the model(s), the compute hardware, quantization and parallelization methods, KV Cache budgets, input and output token length predictions, model adapter management and much more. \n\nIf you want to deeply understand these topics and their effects on LLM inference cost and performance you will enjoy this talk. \n\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\n- Why LLM inference is different to standard deep learning inference\n- Current and future NVIDIA GPU overview - which GPU(s) for which models and why\n- Understanding the importance of building inference engines\n- Deep recap on the attention mechanism along with different types of popular attention mechanisms used in production\n- Deep dive on KV Cache and managing KV Cache budgets to increase throughput per model deployment\n- Parallelism (reducing latency) - mainly tensor parallelism but data, sequence, pipeline and expert parallelism will be highlighted\n- Quantization methods on weights, activations, KV Cache to reduce engine sizes for more effective GPU utilization\n- Increasing throughput with inflight batching and other techniques\n- Detailed performance analysis of LLM deployments looking at Time to first token, inter-token latencies, llm deployment characterizations, and more  that can help reduce deployment costs\n\nThe main inference engine referenced in the talk with TRT-LLM and the open-source inference serve NVIDIA Triton.\"",

For some, recent AI developments might even pose a disruptive shift for their products and company, but how do you balance rapid prototyping and exploration of these disruptive technologies with catering to your current user base to avoid the Innovator's Dilemma? Should you add AI to every product team's roadmap or form a dedicated AI team? How do you experiment with entirely new AI endeavors without risking your current customer base? In other words, how do you cook with fire without burning down the kitchen?  \n\nIn this discussion round, Dominik Kundel will share how Twilio has been tackling some of these challenges, their learnings and what changes/iterations they have been going through to address those learnings, followed by an open discussion for others to share their learnings.",

This case study will cover the strategic evolution from conception, through to launch, and continuous iteration and refinement.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\n- Strategic partnership: The collaboration with OpenAI to launch Khanmigo alongside GPT4, going from prototype to fully launched product in 3 months time. I will delve into the why and how behind our decision to partner with OpenAI, and to leverage generative AI in our product.\n- Cultural shift in product development: The transition from our previous, more traditional product development approach to a highly experimental, prototype-driven culture. This section will highlight how we embedded AI across all teams to enhance our mission, moving beyond isolated AI projects to fully integrate AI into our operational fabric.\n- Khanmigo in action: An in-depth look at Khanmigo's functionality and its solution to real-world challenges faced by students and teachers, coupled with it's impact in real classrooms around the US.\n- Ongoing technical challenges and scaling: An overview of the technical obstacles encountered in scaling and maintaining quality as we continued to add more users.\n- Ethical considerations and AI safety: How we thought of AI safety in the context of the classroom, and delivered on an experience that parents and educators trust. \n- Pilot programs and iterative learning: Insights from our pilot programs across various school districts, focusing on how we've used feedback and data to refine and enhance Khanmigo's capabilities.\"",

            "about": "With nearly two-thirds of enterprise developers planning production deployments of large language models this year, LLM evaluation has never been more important. LLM evaluation is also an area where confusion reigns, starting with ambiguity around what “LLM evals” even means. Often, LLM model evaluation – quantifying general fitness (i.e. on the Hugging Face leaderboard) –  is conflated with task-specific LLM system evaluation. And while many foundation model providers offer their own evals, AI engineers building LLM systems designed to plug into many models or tools need a way to objectively evaluate both different foundation models and their own systems with rigorous techniques. In this session, Arize AI founder Aparna Dhinakaran will release research onstage and walk attendees through real life examples of building an LLM Eval from scratch. This session will build on multiple research pieces that have garnered millions of views across social platforms, diving into techniques to build out robust LLM evals and ultimately gain a better understanding of the limits of LLM capabilities. Want to build your own LLM task evals for a specific use case leveraging open source tools? Want to see the latest research on which foundation models your company should be using for specific use cases? You won’t want to miss this session!",

We were also one of the first companies to build and ship AI features into our core products. We've had the opportunity to work with Braintrust since the early days of the product, which now powers the evaluation and observability infrastructure across our AI features.  \n\nWe’ll walk through a couple of our projects – AI Zap Builder and Zapier Copilot – and how we built them from the ground up with evals and observability in mind. Hopefully, you can walk away with a few of our learnings from operating these projects at scale while systematically improving their performance.",

With the recent rise of generative AI technologies, we have a new event more precious digital resource fueling the digital economy: knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has presented a first generative AI use case for organizations to use their knowledge resources, like documentation, knowledge bases, and code repositories. This talk explores various other ways that organizations can use the knowledge resources they ingest for RAG to fuel growth and productivity. Use cases for knowledge resources covered in this presentation include: traditional natural language processing, fine-tuning models, and creating knowledge APIs for AI agents to consume. Attendees will come away from this talk with actionable guidance on how they can leverage their knowledge resources for maximum efficacy.",

ChatGPT doesn’t know anything about your codebase, and even tools that are supposed to be able to answer questions about it often fail.\n\nStarting from simply being able to talk about a single file, to being able to include specific files, then incorporating code search, coding assistants have evolved a lot over the past year or so.\n\nHowever, most coding assistants are still not able to incorporate the full context of your codebase as well as things like Linear issues, design docs on Notion, and more.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll take you on a journey of how we fixed this problem by leveraging new and interesting strategies to incorporate just the right context without blowing up your context window.\"",

Enter OctoStack, the new Generative AI inference stack that you can deploy to any environment. In this talk, we'll tell you exactly how we got OctoStack to outperform DIY deployments, including VLLM, by 10X for high-concurrency use cases. We've spent a decade optimizing the heck out of the whole stack, and now we're ready spill all our secrets. If speculative decoding, custom kernels and CUDA graphs pique your interest, you're our kind of nerd. Come check it out! ",

When working with open source LLMs like Llama 3, the need to rigorously evaluate is crucial as many more adjustments can be made that influence the Tool Calling process.\n\nDuring this talk you will learn what a baseline evaluation looks like and how a tradeoff surface emerges as you decide on implementation details like fine tuning, prompt/encoding choices, streaming, retries, and more.",

Navigating a sea of cloud providers or trying to rapidly scale up on-prem compute can be difficult at best -- just when you find the perfect solution at a fair price, you learn the lead time is too long or the hardware is not as reliable as advertised. If only there was a way to access exactly the amount of training compute power you need precisely when you need it.\nWe are excited to introduce 1-Click Clusters, a new way to perform distributed training at scale. 1CC is a flexible way to access GPU clusters of all sizes for weeks or months at a time. Whether your project needs a quick burst of extra power or might scale up and down over time, you can reserve compute as simply as booking a hotel room. We will discuss features and how things work beneath the software to help you learn what to look out for and how to maximize your training efficiency.",

Because fundamentally users can ask all kinds of questions that you as a developer may not have prepared for. So what we really need is AI doing RAG for us. Enter agentic RAG.\n\nIn this talk, we make a case for why agentic RAG is the future of RAG apps. Instead of spending time setting up complex RAG pipelines, developers should be spending time preparing quality data and letting the RAG agents do the heavy lifting of query planning, data retrieval and LLM orchestration. Developers should also be able to observe the RAG agent and be able to make it perform better continuously. We will show a quick demo of Pacha, the world’s first RAG agent that works with private data.",

You will come away with an understanding of how knowledge graphs can play the critical role of left brain to complement the statistically-derived LLM + Vector right brain. You will hear how these two techniques can work together to create more reliable and powerful solutions, in an enterprise landscape where many GenAI use cases call for the use of both hemispheres.",

This talk explores the capabilities and power of the Modular Mojo programming language and Modular Accelerated Xecution (MAX) platform, which unifies CPU and GPU programming into a single Pythonic programming model that is simple and extensible. This results in reduced complexity and improved developer productivity, and streamlines innovation. We'll walk through CPU and GPU support with real-world examples, providing details of how AI application developers can use MAX and Mojo to define an end-to-end AI pipeline and overcome the complexities.

What if the key to understanding the intricate mechanics of LLMs didn't require a Ph.D.? This session offers an innovative approach, employing spreadsheets to dissect and demystify the architecture of decoder-based LLMs using a fully working implementation of GPT-2 entirely in Excel. Attendees will tour through GPT-2's architecture from tokenization, embeddings, attention, multi-layer perceptron, all translated into the accessible format of spreadsheets with minimal abstractions to get in the way. By the end, you'll gain unparalleled insights into AI's backbone, transforming abstract concepts into tangible, understandable processes, without ever touching code.",

Given security \u0026 privacy concerns, your app won't have direct access to these databases.\nMaking independent retrieval requests to each of these sources and then joining them in memory might be prohibitively expensive and needs a level of query planning to do efficiently.\nMoving all data into one location is expensive to build, maintain and govern \nPredictable quality is further made hard because underlying data formats and storage interfaces are continuously changing.\nDifferent types of user queries might require additional filtering and joining of data, which becomes hard to generalize.\n\nAPIs solve almost all of these very well known challenges. APIs offer standardization and security. APIs can provide a stable contract to interact with underlying data.\nAnd in all likelihood, you already have APIs on these internal and external data sources. \n\nIronically, while APIs have become a necessity for other parts of the stack, they are clearly not the first thing that AI engineers building RAG reach for. \n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss:\nWhy API based retrieval doesn't work well for RAG\nWhat we need from our existing internal and external APIs to make them RAG ready\nHow we can get existing APIs to become RAG ready without needing to rebuild the APIs\n\nBased on our work at Hasura with early-stage AI startups and Fortune 100 customers alike, I'll share key learnings on how we can set the stage to experiment and productionize RAG.\n\nThis talk will be technical, with code demos (possibly with some live coding!) and end with key resources (reference architectures, API best practices, tools/technologies) that attendees can take back to their work.\"",

What would it take to build a general intelligence that’s truly useful to humanity—a general-purpose toolkit that levels up the intelligence of both humans and computers while keeping us in the driver’s seat? We propose Useful General Intelligence (UGI): a common language for humans and computers. UGI is both a meta-tool for doing computer work and a meta-interface for the computer, and it involves agents that not only execute explicitly stated goals but also infer them implicitly. In this talk, we show how we’re developing the building blocks for UGI with a range of enterprise customers. ",

In this talk, we'll cover how we've dramatically accelerated our modeling pipeline with (1) human-AI hybrid dataset generation for different harm vectors, (2) automated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of open-source large language and multimodal models for violation detection, and (3) serving fine-tuned adapters efficiently in real-time and at scale using LoRAX and cascade classification.",

And now, faced with actually deploying these models at scale, AI engineers and builders are left to pick up the pieces on how to improve latency and resource consumption practically. In parallel, the on-device AI movement is heating up, imposing even more physical constraints on AI model deployment. In this talk, we will first identify key sources of inefficiency in AI models. Then, we will discuss techniques and practical tools to improve efficiency, from model architecture selection, to quantization, to prompt optimization.",

However, the efficient deployment of LLMs in production environments reveals a landscape of challenges and technical debt.\n\nEthically, LLMs face issues such as bias amplification, where they might perpetuate existing stereotypes in their outputs. Misinformation is another concern, with the potential misuse of LLMs to create convincing yet false narratives. Privacy risks emerge from LLMs possibly memorizing and revealing personal data. Moreover, societal challenges include the impact on employment, as LLMs could automate tasks but also lead to job displacement. These challenges highlight the need for careful management and ethical considerations in the deployment of LLMs.\n\nIn this talk, Ahmed will highlight the key challenges and technical debt associated with LLMs' deployment, which demands customization and sophisticated engineering solutions not readily available in broad-use machine learning libraries or inference engines.\"",

What if there was a better way to train, fine-tune, and serve models on accelerated compute infrastructure entirely in Python? See how during this session where we fine-tune 20 Llama models without doing any infrastructure work. Startups and enterprises can finally gain unprecedented speed and agility to build, iterate, and deploy anything that they can imagine, from multi-agent, multi-modal AI applications, to digital twins for real world simulation. What used to take weeks with dozens of best-in-class engineers can now be accomplished in hours from a single notebook.",

            "about": "This talk explores how MongoDB's Aggregation Framework transcends limitations of \"classic RAG\". While RAG utilizes vector representations and semantic relevance for data retrieval, it often relies on pre-defined knowledge bases, limiting the scope of analysis. The Aggregation Framework, on the other hand, empowers you to analyze entire collections directly within MongoDB. Furthermore, the Aggregation Framework offers unparalleled flexibility for complex calculations and data transformation.",
